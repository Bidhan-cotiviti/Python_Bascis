Hello Guys
My name is Bidhan Khatiwada
I live in Khthmandu Nepal

text = "fragnance By calvein kein for women"

# Find the indices of "By" and "for" in the text
by_index = text.find("By")
for_index = text.find("for")

# Extract the title, brand, and category
title = text[:for_index].strip()
brand = text[by_index + 3:for_index].strip()
category = text[for_index + 3:].strip()

# Save the extracted information to respective files
with open("title.txt", "w") as title_file:
    title_file.write(f"title: {title}")

with open("brand.txt", "w") as brand_file:
    brand_file.write(f"brand: {brand}")

with open("category.txt", "w") as category_file:
    category_file.write(f"category: {category}")
